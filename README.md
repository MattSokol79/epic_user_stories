# User & Epic Stories
## User Stories
When consulting with a client or product owner, the team divides the work to be done into functional increments called "user stories"
Each user story is expected to yield, once implemented, a contribution to the value of the overall product, irrespective of the order
of implementation.

**Example:** Trello cards, each card is a user story which when completed contributes to the overall DevOps education. 

**SCRUM** - Every morning user cards are generated and moved around to show tasks needing to be done and ones that were finished.

**Agile** - Repeating the process on Trello means that we are constantly evaluating what tasks need to be done and which ones not.
Process can be repeated for every new development project

Benefits include:
- Reducing the risks of delay, especially if the increments are small and software is released frequently.
- Client has the option to change the order of tasks.
- Developers can see exactly what they are doing thus promoting efficiency and discipline as well as reducing stress. 

## Epic User Stories
An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split
into smaller user stories.
Epic stories allow you to keep track of large, loosely defined ideas in your backlog without the need to overpopulate your backlog
with multiple items. The team will most likely split an epic user story into smaller user stories to make development much 
more efficient and understandable. 

**Example:** - Backing up an entire hard drive (EPIC STORY). The task is too large for an agile team to complete in one iteration
, it is split into multiple smaller user stories before being worked on (could be split into dozens of stories) - As a user
i can specify files or folders to backup based on file size. As a user I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup
drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved. 

**SCRUM** - Concept of epics is particularly useful when you are following SCRUM as it has explicit timeboxed iterations (sprints).
Most of the time will organise work into 2 - 4 week sprints.

**Agile** - Splitting large epic user stories/tasks into more manageable smaller user stories and doing iterations (i.e design,
work/develop and test to make sure it worked) 

Benefits:
- Reduces stress placed on a team to complete a project which is very complex as its broken down into more manageable user stories
- Improves efficiency as developers know exactly how to approach a project when its broken down
